# Overlay

To run this overlay, follow these steps:

1. Make sure you have Node.js installed. If not, download and install it from the official [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) website.
2. Clone the repository or download the ZIP archive.
3. Open a terminal in the projectâ€™s root directory and install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
4. Start the overlay with
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

Notice: I couldn't get permission from the overlay, so I commented out the code to work with it. My overlay currently uses random data.
