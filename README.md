# Overlay

To run this overlay, follow these steps:

1. Make sure you have Node.js installed. If not, download and install it from the official [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) website.
2. Download the ZIP archive or clone the repository
    ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Okarix/overlay.git
   ```
4. Open a terminal in the projectâ€™s root directory and install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
5. Start the overlay with
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

Notice: I couldn't get permission from the overwolf, so I commented out the code to work with it. My overlay currently uses random data.
